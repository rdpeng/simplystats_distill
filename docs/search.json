The views represented here are our own and do not\nrepresent the views of Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University or\nDana Farber Cancer Institute.\nAbout this blog: We’ll be posting ideas we find\ninteresting, contributing to discussion of science/popular writing,\nlinking to articles that inspire us, and sharing advice with\nup-and-coming statisticians.\nWhy “Simply Statistics”: We needed a title. Plus, we\nlike the idea of using simple statistics to solve real, important\nproblems. We aren’t fans of unnecessary complication – that just leads\nto lies, damn lies and something else.\n\n\n\n",
