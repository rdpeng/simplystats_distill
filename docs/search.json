The views represented here are our own and do not represent the views of Johns Hopkins University, Harvard University or Dana Farber Cancer Institute.\nAbout this blog: We’ll be posting ideas we find interesting, contributing to discussion of science/popular writing, linking to articles that inspire us, and sharing advice with up-and-coming statisticians.\nWhy “Simply Statistics”: We needed a title. Plus, we like the idea of using simple statistics to solve real, important problems. We aren’t fans of unnecessary complication – that just leads to lies, damn lies and something else.\n\n\n\n",
