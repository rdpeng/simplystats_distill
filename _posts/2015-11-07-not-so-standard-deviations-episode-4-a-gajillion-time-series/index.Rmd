Episode 4 of Not So Standard Deviations is hot off the audio editor. In this episode Hilary first explains to me what heck is DevOps and then we talk about the statistical challenges in detecting rare events in an enormous set of time series data. There's also some discussion of Ben and Jerry's and the t-test, so you'll want to hang on for that.
