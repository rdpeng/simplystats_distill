On May 3rd I gave my Dean's lecture titled "The Past and Future of Data Analysis", which was a lot of fun and gave me the opportunity to play lots of different kinds of music on stage! I talked a little bit about it on the latest episode of [Not So Standard Deviations](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast/episode-38-banging-on-the-piano). Now the School has posted the full video of the lecture and you can watch it here:
