The other day on Twitter Amelia requested a guide for reading papers

    I love <a href="https://twitter.com/jtleek">@jtleek</a>â€™s github guides to reviewing papers, writing R packages, giving talks, etc. Would love one on reading papers, for students.

So I came up with a guide which you can find here: [Leek group guide to reading papers](https://github.com/jtleek/readingpapers). I actually found this to be one that I had the hardest time with. I described how I tend to read a paper but I'm not sure that is really the optimal (or even a very good) way. I'd really appreciate pull requests if you have ideas on how to improve the guide.
