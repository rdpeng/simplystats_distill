Sorry for the delay with my session picks for Wednesday. Here's what I'm thinking of:

  * <span style="line-height: 16px;">8:30-10:20am: <b>Bayesian Methods for Causal Inference in Complex Settings </b>(CC-520a) or <b>Developments in Statistical Methods for Functional and Imaging Data </b>(CC-522bc)</span>
  * 10:30am-12:20pm: **Spatial Statistics for Environmental Health Studies** (CC-510c) or **Big Data Exploration with Amazon** (CC-516c)
  * 2-3:50pm: There are some future stars in the session **Environmental Impacts on Public and Ecological Health** (CC-512h) and **Statistical Challenges in Cancer Genomics with Next-Generation Sequencing and Microarrays** (CC-514a)
  * 4-5:50pm: Find out who won the COPSS award! (CC-517ab)
