Yesterday I posted [about atomizing statistical education into knowledge units](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/02/04/knowledge-units-the-atoms-of-statistical-education/). You can try out the first knowledge unit here:Â <https://jtleek.typeform.com/to/jMPZQe>. The early data is in and it is consistent with many of our hypotheses about the future of online education.

Namely:

  1. Completion rates are high when segments are shorter
  2. You can learn something about statistics in a short amount of time (2 minutes to complete, many people got all questions right)
  3. People will consume educational material on tablets/smartphones more and more.
