_Editor's note: We are trying something a little new here and doing an interview with Google Hangouts on Air. The interview will be live at 11:30am EST. I have some questions lined up for Chris, but if you have others you'd like to ask, you can tweet them @simplystats and I'll see if I can work them in. After the livestream we'll leave the video on Youtube so you can check out the interview if you can't watch the live stream. I'm embedding the Youtube video here but if you can't see the live stream when it is running go check out the event page:Â <https://plus.google.com/events/c7chrkg0ene47mikqrvevrg3a4o>._
