_Editor's note: For the last few years I have made a list of awesome things that other people did ([2016](https://simplystatistics.org/2016/12/20/noncomprehensive-list-of-awesome/),[2015](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/12/21/a-non-comprehensive-list-of-awesome-things-other-people-did-in-2015/), [2014](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/12/17/a-non-comprehensive-list-of-awesome-things-other-people-did-in-2014/), [2013](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/12/20/a-non-comprehensive-list-of-awesome-things-other-people-did-this-year/)). Like in previous years I'm making a list, again right off the top of my head.  If you know of some, you should make your own list or add it to the comments! I have also avoided talking about stuff I worked on or that people here at Hopkins are doing because this post is supposed to be about other people’s awesome stuff. I write this post because a blog often feels like a place to complain, but we started Simply Stats as a place to be pumped up about the stuff people were doing with data._


* Amelia McNamara and Aran Lunzer made this [crazy nice illustration](http://tinlizzie.org/histograms/) of how histograms work. 
* I am just continuously impressed by the work coming out of Rahul Satija's group - this year it was [this paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/18/164889) on aligning cell populations in single cell data. 
* Karl Broman and Kara Woo wrote the [definitive guide to data in spreadsheets](https://peerj.com/preprints/3183/) with the winner for most dense delivery of valuable information in a sentence in the last sentence of the abstract. 
* The rest of the papers in the [Peerj data science collection](https://peerj.com/collections/50-practicaldatascistats/) are also awesome. 
* Thomas Lin Pederson came out with the [patchwork](https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork) package for composing plots. This is the plot organization software I've always wanted :). 
* Getting [Avericked](https://twitter.com/dataandme) became a word as Mara Averick somehow makes everything R related look _so cool_.
* The folks at [Fast.AI](http://www.fast.ai/) do so many impressive things (they are MOOC geniuses) its hard to list just one to list, but this [post on data ethics](http://www.fast.ai/2017/11/02/ethics/) might be my favorite. 
* Kristian Lum wrote the [most important blog post in statistics](https://medium.com/@kristianlum/statistics-we-have-a-problem-304638dc5de5) and jump-started the discussion throughout our field on the standard of behavior we want to hold ourselves to as a field. 
* Hadley Wickham is the LeBron James of data science - so effortlessly great it is almost expected. [usethis](https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/2017/11/usethis-1.0.0/) is yet another example of how he's revolutionizing package development (again). 
* I looooovveeddd this post from [Julia Silge](https://juliasilge.com/blog/tidy-word-vectors/) on how to do word2vec like things with tidy data. Such a beautiful distillation of something complicated into something we all can do. 
* I only bought one stats book all year. It was [David Robinson's Empirical Bayes Book](http://varianceexplained.org/r/empirical-bayes-book/). An insta-classic. 
* I've been following Nick Strayer's dive into deep learning all year on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NicholasStrayer), this post on [LSTM with a baseball analogy](http://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/11/08/lstm-neural-nets-as-told-by-baseball/) is a good example of the awesomeness. 
* Jeff Kao had a [tour de force](https://hackernoon.com/more-than-a-million-pro-repeal-net-neutrality-comments-were-likely-faked-e9f0e3ed36a6) post on identifying fake comments on the net neutrality repeal. Such an impressively timed and high impact piece of forensic data science. 
* Mike Love released his [amazing lecture notes](https://twitter.com/mikelove/status/940220932475510784) for his intro to computational Biology class. I want to take a class from Mike. 
* The [keras](https://keras.rstudio.com/) R package is sooooo nice. I love everything JJ Allaire does - whenever he writes software it always seems like he's read my mind and the way I'd want the software to work it just does. 
* Jesse Meagan's post on [educational data wrangling](https://medium.com/@kierisi/share-the-code-adventures-in-education-data-wrangling-11f2509272cb) was realy close to my heart. Plus it is so awesome to read about her (impressive) transition from Excel to R. Something I'm thinking about a ton these days. 
* I've been gobbling up Cristoph Molnar's [book on interpretable machine learning](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/). 
* The book on [tidytextmining](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) came out this year. What a tour-de-force from Julia Silge and David Robinson. 
* I read a lot of FastForward blog posts this year - one of my favorites was this one on [auditing machine learning models](http://blog.fastforwardlabs.com/2017/03/09/fairml-auditing-black-box-predictive-models.html) - such an important topic. 
* I love this post on the [ten fallacies of data science](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ten-fallacies-of-data-science-9b2af78a1862) - my favorite one? "The data exist". 
* I basically read every one of Ma&euml;lle Salmon's blog post but I found her analysis of [seeds that people use in R](http://www.masalmon.eu/2017/04/12/seeds/) to be fascinating. I'm looking forward to more on the epidemiology of code :). 
* I dug Emily Robinson's [post on making R code faster](https://robinsones.github.io/Making-R-Code-Faster-A-Case-Study/) this is something I'm adding to every class I teach in the future - so nice to see all the steps laid out so clearly! 
* Natalie Telis did one of the most impressive [crowd sourced studies](https://telis.blog/2017/11/06/questions-and-answers-about-questions/) of who is asking questions at the major genetics conference. I think solutions like this are so clever when they are low cost/low overhead but produce super interesting results. 
* I liked Stephen Turner's updated post on [how to stay current in Bioinformatics](http://www.gettinggeneticsdone.com/2017/02/staying-current-in-bioinformatics-genomics-2017.html). Keeping up is super hard to do well - so this is a big service for the community. 
* Its hard to point to just one thing Karthik Ram does for the R community in any given year, but I was pumped to see this call for [rOpenSci fellows](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/07/06/ropensci-fellowships/). I know I'm going to hit peak FOMO whenever Karthik is organizing. 
* My main goal as an advisor is to be like [Marta Kutas](http://socialsciences.ucsd.edu/econnection/spring2017/marta-kutas.html)- _"I don’t care what they become,” she says of her students, “so long as it’s decent, thinking human beings!"_
* I'm such a fan of Rob Hyndman's forcasting work, and was pumped to see him on [Datacamp](https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/datacamp/). The data camp folks have been just vacuming up awesome people to teach courses. 
* Andrew Bream did an amazing, polite, and thorough job of [setting me straight on deep learning](https://beamandrew.github.io/deeplearning/2017/06/04/deep_learning_works.html).
* The [UpSetR](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/03/25/120600) package was a heartwarming contribution for those of us who are terrified of out of control Venn diagrams. * I think Florian Markowetz consistently is one of the most thoughtful computational scientists. I read his stuff relentelessly but loved his idea for a [pre-registration of the Human Cell Atlas](https://scientificbsides.wordpress.com/2017/05/18/the-human-cell-atlas-needs-a-pre-registered-analysis-plan/). 
* It was the year of [datasaurus](https://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications/samestats)! I am in the process of replacing all my Anscomb quartet lecture notes. What a cool idea by Justin Matejka and George Fitzmaurice. 
* There are times when I wonder whether Emma Pierson has created multiple AI copies of herself. How can one person write [so](https://www.wired.com/2017/04/hey-computer-scientists-stop-hating-humanities/), [many](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05678), [awesome](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08536), [things](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08230) in one year? 
* Ben Haibe-Kains and colleagues put together a tour-de-force in reproducibility [with PharmacoDB](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkx911/4372597).
* There is often talk of how academic statistics isn't supportive enough of non-standard (read: non-math) contributions. There is definitely truth there, but I love [Lance Waller](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/01/25/103093) on navigating these non-standard paths in academics. 
* I am so amped about the [skimr](https://ropensci.org/blog/2017/07/11/skimr/) package, especially the histograms as part of the summary statistics. 
* Christie Aschwanden added another [awesome piece](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-easiest-way-to-dismiss-good-science-demand-sound-science/) to her collection of the most level-headed, responsible, and thoughtful discusison of the statistical issues in science. 

That's all I have for the moment. I'm sure I missed a ton and I'm sorry if I missed you - please add more in the comments I always love to see cool stuff!
