Jeff Leek, Brian Caffo, and I are doing a [Reddit AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA) TODAY at 3pm EST. We're happy to answer questions about...anything...including our roles as Co-Directors of the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) as well as the [Executive Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/executive-data-science).

This is one of the few pictures of the three of us together.
