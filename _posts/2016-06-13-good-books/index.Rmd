The MultiThreaded blog over at Stitch Fix (hat tip to Hilary Parker)
has posted a [really nice list of data science books](http://multithreaded.stitchfix.com/blog/2016/06/09/ds-books/) (disclosure: one
of [my books](https://leanpub.com/artofdatascience/) is on the list).

> Weâ€™ve queried our data science team for some of their favorite data science books. This list is by no means exhaustive, but should keep any data scientist/engineer new or old learning and entertained for many an evening.

Enjoy!
