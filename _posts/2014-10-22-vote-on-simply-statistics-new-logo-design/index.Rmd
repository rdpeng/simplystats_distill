As you can tell, we have given the Simply Stats blog a little style update. It should be more readable on phones or tablets now. We are also about to get a new logo. We are down to the last couple of choices and can't decide. Since we are statisticians, we thought we'd collect some data. [Here is the link](http://99designs.com/logo-design/vote-3datw8) to the poll. Let us know
