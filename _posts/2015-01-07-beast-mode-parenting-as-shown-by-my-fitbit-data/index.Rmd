This weekend was one of those hardcore parenting weekends that any parent of little kids will understand. We were up and actively taking care of kids for a huge fraction of the weekend. (Un)fortunately I was wearing my Fitbit, so I can quantify exactly how little we were sleeping over the weekend.

Here is Saturday:

There you can see that I rocked about midnight-4am without running around chasing a kid or bouncing one to sleep. But Sunday was the real winner:

Check that out. I was totally asleep from like 4am-6am there. Nice.

Stay tuned for much more from my Fitbit data over the next few weeks.
