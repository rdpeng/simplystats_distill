Back in January we interviewed <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/16170052064/interview-with-joe-blitzstein" target="_blank">Joe Blitzstein</a> and pointed out that he made his lectures freely available on iTunes. Now it is a course on <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/course/statistics-110-probability/id502492375" target="_blank">iTunes</a> and the format has been upgraded to work better with iPhones and iPads. Enjoy!
