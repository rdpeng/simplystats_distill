I like all of [CGP Grey's](https://www.youtube.com/cgpgrey) videos but most of them have to do with voting systems and so aren't really relevant to this blog. But his latest video titled ["How Do Machines Learn?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9OHn5ZF4Uo) is highly relevant and I thought very well done. That said, although the animations of the robots were very cute and helped to tell the story, I found them a bit disconcerting in a way that I can't quite explain.
