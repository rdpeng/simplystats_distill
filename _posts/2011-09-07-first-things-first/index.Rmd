**About us:**

We are three professors who are fired up about the new era where data is abundant and statisticians are scientists. 

**About this blog:**

We&#8217;ll be posting ideas we find interesting, contributing to discussion of science/popular writing, and linking to articles that inspire us. 

**Why &#8220;Simply Statistics&#8221;:**

We needed a title. Plus, we like the idea of using simple statistics to solve real, important problems. We aren&#8217;t fans of unnecessary complication - that just leads to lies, damn lies and something else.
