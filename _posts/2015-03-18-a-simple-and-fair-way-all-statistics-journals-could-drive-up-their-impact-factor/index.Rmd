Hypothesis:

> If every method in every stats journal was implemented in a corresponding R package ([easy](http://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/)), was required to have a Â companion document that was a tutorial on how to use the software ([easy](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/package-vignettes/)), included a reference to how to cite the paper if you used the software ([easy](http://www.inside-r.org/r-doc/utils/citation)) and the paper/tutorial was posted to the relevant message boards for the communities of interest ([easy](http://seqanswers.com/forums/showthread.php?t=42018)) that journal would see a dramatic bump in its impact factor.
