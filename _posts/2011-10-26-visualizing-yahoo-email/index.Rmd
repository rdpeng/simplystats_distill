<a href="http://visualize.yahoo.com/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a cool page where yahoo shows you the email it is processing in real time. It includes a visualization of the most popular words in emails at a given time. A pretty neat tool and definitely good for procrastination, but I&#8217;m not sure what else it is good for&#8230;
