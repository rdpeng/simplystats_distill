Episode 2 of my podcast with Hilary Parker, [Not So Standard Deviations](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast), is out! In this episode, we talk about user testing for statistical methods, navigating the Hadleyverse, the crucial significance of rename(), and the secret reason for creating the podcast (hint: it rhymes with "bee"). Also, I erroneously claim that [Bill Cleveland](http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wsc/) is _way_ older than he actually is. Sorry Bill.

In other news, [we are finally on iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/not-so-standard-deviations/id1040614570) so you can subscribe from there directly if you want (just search for "Not So Standard Deviations" or paste the link directly into your podcatcher.
