Most have probably seen this already since it happend a few days ago, but <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/14/technology/dennis-ritchie-programming-trailblazer-dies-at-70.html">Dennis Ritchie died</a>. It just blows my mind how influential his work was — developing the C language, Unix — and how so many pieces of technology bear his fingerprints. 

My first encounter with K&R was in college when I learned C programming in the “Data Structures and Programming Techniques” class at Yale (taught by <a href="http://www.cs.yale.edu/people/eisenstat.html" target="_blank">Stan &#8220;the man&#8221; Eisenstadt</a>). Looking back, his book seems fairly easy to read and understand, but I must have cursed that book a million times when I took that course!
