<a href="http://thatsmathematics.com/mathgen/" target="_blank">Mathgen</a>, the web site that can produce randomly generated mathematics papers has apparently <a href="http://thatsmathematics.com/blog/archives/102" target="_blank">gotten a paper accepted in a peer-reviewed journal</a> (although perhaps not the most reputable one). I am not at all surprised this happened, but it&#8217;s fun to read both the paper and the reviewer&#8217;s comments.Â 

(Thanks to Kasper H. for the pointer.)
