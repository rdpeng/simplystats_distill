There has been a lot of discussion of peer review on this blog and elsewhere. One thing I realized is that no one ever formally taught me the point of peer review or how to write a review.

Like a lot of other people, I have been [frustrated by the peer review process](http://simplystatistics.org/2012/07/11/my-worst-recent-experience-with-peer-review/). I also now frequently turn to my students to perform supervised peer review of papers, both for their education and because I can't handle the large number of peer review requests I get on my own.

So I wrote [this guide](https://github.com/jtleek/reviews) on how to write a review of  a scientific paper on Github. Last time I did this [with R packages ](http://simplystatistics.org/2013/10/07/the-leek-group-policy-for-developing-sustainable-r-packages/)a bunch of people contributed to make the guide better. I hope that the same thing will happen this time.
