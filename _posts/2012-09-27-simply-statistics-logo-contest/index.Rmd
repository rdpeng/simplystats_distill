Simply Statistics has had the same logo since Roger grabbed the first picture in his results folder that looked &#8220;statistics related&#8221;. While we do have some affection for the logo, we would like something a little more catchy.

So we would like to announce a contest to create our **new** logo. Here are the rules:

  1. All submissions must be sent to Roger with the email subject, &#8220;Simply Statistics Logo Contest&#8221;
  2. The logo must be generated with reproducible R code. Here is <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2011/12/using-r-to-create-a-logo-simple.html" target="_blank">an example</a> of how Simple created their logo for inspiration. 
  3. Ideally the logo will convey the &#8220;spirit of the blog&#8221;: we like data, we like keeping it simple, we like solving real problems, and we like to stir it up.

Have at it!
