Okay, this is not really about <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/9916412456/pre-cog-and-stats" target="_blank">pre-cog</a>, but just a pointer to some data that might be of interest to people. A number of cities post their crime data online, ready for scraping and data analysis. For example, the Baltimore Sun has a <a title="Baltimore homicide data" target="_blank" href="http://essentials.baltimoresun.com/micro_sun/homicides/index.php">Google map of homicides</a> in the city of Baltimore. There&#8217;s also some data for <a title="Oakland homicide data" target="_blank" href="http://www.sfgate.com/maps/oaklandhomicides/">Oakland</a>.

Looking at the map is fun, but not particularly useful from a data analysis standpoint. However, with a little fiddling (and some knowledge of XML), you can pull the data from the map and use it for data analysis.

Why not build your own model to predict crime?

I&#8217;ll just add that the model used in the pre-cog program was published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association in <a href="http://pubs.amstat.org/doi/abs/10.1198/jasa.2011.ap09546" target="_blank">this article</a>.
