Tomorrow is the [Unconference on the Future of Statistics](https://plus.google.com/events/cd94ktf46i1hbi4mbqbbvvga358) from 12PM-1PM EDT. There are two ways that you can get in the game:

  1. <span style="line-height: 16px;">Ask questions for our speakers on Twitter with the hashtag #futureofstats. Don't wait, start right now, Roger, Rafa, and I are monitoring the hashtag and collecting questions. We will pick some to ask the speakers tomorrow during the Unconference.Â </span>
  2. If you have an idea about the future of statistics write it up, post it on Github, on Blogger, on WordPress, on your personal website, then tweet it with the hashtag #futureofstats. We will do our best to collect these and post them with the video so your contributions will be part of the Unconference.
