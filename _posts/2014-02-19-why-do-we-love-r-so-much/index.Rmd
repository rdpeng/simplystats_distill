When Jeff, Brian, and I started the [Johns Hopkins Data Science Specialization](http://jhudatascience.org) we decided early on to organize the program around using R. Why? Because we love R, we use it everyday, and it has an incredible community of developers and users. The R community has created an ecosystem of packages and tools that lets R continue to be relevant and useful for real problems.

We created a short video to talk about one of the reasons we love R so much.
