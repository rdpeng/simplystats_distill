I'm happy to announce that I've started a brand new podcast called [Not So Standard Deviations](https://soundcloud.com/nssd-podcast) with Hilary Parker at Etsy. Episode 1 "RCatLadies Origin Story" is available through SoundCloud. In this episode we talk about the origins of RCatLadies, evidence-based data analysis, my new book, and the Python vs. R debate.

You can subscribe to the podcast using the [RSS feed](http://feeds.soundcloud.com/users/soundcloud:users:174789515/sounds.rss) from SoundCloud. We'll be getting it up on iTunes hopefully very soon.
