From [Technical.ly Baltimore](http://technical.ly/baltimore/2015/07/07/jhu-umd-big-data-maryland-advanced-research-computing-center-marcc/):

> A nondescript, 3,700-square-foot building on Johns Hopkins’ Bayview campus will house a new data storage and computing center for university researchers. The $30 million Maryland Advanced Research Computing Center (MARCC) will be available to faculty from JHU and the University of Maryland, College Park.

The web site has a pretty cool time-lapse video of the construction of the computing center. There's also a bit more detail at the [JHU Hub](http://hub.jhu.edu/2015/07/06/computing-center-bayview) site.
