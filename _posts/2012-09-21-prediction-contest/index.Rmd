I have been seeing <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v489/n7415/full/489201a.html" target="_blank">this paper</a> all over Twitter/the blogosphere. It&#8217;s a sexy idea: can you predict how &#8220;high-impact&#8221; a scientist will be in the future. It is also a pretty flawed data analysis&#8230;so this weeks prediction contest is to identify why the statistics in this paper are so flawed. In my first pass read I noticed about 5 major flaws.

_Editor&#8217;s note: I posted the criticisms and the authors respond here:Â <a href="http://disq.us/8bmrhl" target="_blank"><a href="http://disq.us/8bmrhl" target="_blank">http://disq.us/8bmrhl</a></a>_
