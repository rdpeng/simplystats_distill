This is not about statistics, but it&#8217;s about Emacs, which I&#8217;ve been using for a long time. This guy is an Emacs virtuoso, and the crazy thing is that he&#8217;s only been using it for 8 months!

Best line: &#8220;Should I wait for the next version of Emacs? Hell no!&#8221;

(Thanks to Brian C. and Kasper H. for the pointer.)
