Thanks to <a href="http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~hiparker/" target="_blank">Hilary Parker</a> for pointing out <a href="http://www.google.com/fusiontables/public/tour/index.html#" target="_blank">Google Fusion Tables</a>. The coolest thing here, from my self-centered spatial statistics point of view, is that it automatically geocodes locations for you. So you can upload a spreadsheet of addresses and it will map them for you on Google Maps.

Unfortunately, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be an easy way to extract the latitude/longitude values, but I&#8217;m hoping that&#8217;s just a quick hack away&#8230;.
