The West Wing was always a favorite show of mine (at least, seasons 1-4, the Sorkin years) and I think this is a great scene which talks about the difference between evidence and interpretation. The topic is a 5-day waiting period for gun purchases and they&#8217;ve just received a poll in a few specific congressional districts showing weak support for this proposed policy.
