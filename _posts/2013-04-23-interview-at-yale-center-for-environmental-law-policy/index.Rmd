[Interview with Roger Peng](http://vimeo.com/64067594) from [YCELP](http://vimeo.com/ycelp) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).

A few weeks ago I sat down with Angel Hsu of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy to talk about some of their work on air pollution indicators.

(Note: I haven't moved--I still work at the John_**s**_ Hopkins School of Public Health.)
