Someone needs to put [this](http://www.digibarn.com/collections/business-docs/apple-II-DOS/index.html) on GitHub right now.

> Thanks Paul Laughton for your donation of this superb collection of early to mid-1978 documents including the letters, agreements, specifications (including hand-written code and schematics), and two original source code listing for the creation of the Apple II "DOS" (Disk Operating System).This was, of course, Apple's first operating system, written not by Steve Wozniak ("Woz") but by an external contractor (Paul Laughton working for Shepardson Microsystems). Woz lacked the skills to write an OS (as did anyone then at Apple). Paul authored the actual Apple II DOS to its release in the fall of 1978.

Update: At this point I see some GitHub stub accounts, but no real code (yet).
