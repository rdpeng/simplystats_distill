OK Cupid is an online dating site that has grown its visibility in part through a pretty awesome blog called <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/" target="_blank">OK Trends</a>, where they have analyzed their online dating data to, for example, <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-4-big-myths-of-profile-pictures/" target="_blank">show you what kind of profile picture works best</a>. Now, they have compiled <a href="http://www.infochimps.com/datasets/personality-insights-okcupid-questions-and-answers-by-gender-age" target="_blank">data</a> from their personality survey and made it available online through <a href="http://www.infochimps.com/" target="_blank">Infochimps</a>. We have talked about Infochimps before, it is basically a site for distributing/selling data. Unfortunately, the OK Cupid data costs $1000. I can think of some cool analyses we could do with this data, but unfortunately the price is a little steep for me. Anybody got a grand they want to give me to buy some data?Â
