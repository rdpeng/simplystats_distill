<span>As Reeves alluded to in <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/19646774024/laws-of-nature-and-the-law-of-patents-supreme-court" target="_blank">his post</a> about the Mayo personalized medicine case, the Supreme Court just vacated the lower court&#8217;s ruling in </span>_Association for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics_<span> (No. 11-725). The case has been sent back down to the Federal Circuit for reconsideration in light of the Court&#8217;s decision in </span>_Mayo_<span>.  This means that the Supreme Court thought the two cases were sufficiently similar that the lower courts should take another look using the new direction from </span>_Mayo_<span>.</span>

<span> It&#8217;s looking more and more like the Supreme Court is strongly opposed to personalized medicine patents. </span>
