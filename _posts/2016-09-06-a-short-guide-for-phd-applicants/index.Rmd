This summer I had several conversations with undergraduate
students seeking career advice. All were interested in data analysis
and were considering graduate school. I also frequently receive 
requests for advice via email. We have posted on this topic
before, for example
[here](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/02/18/navigating-big-data-careers-with-a-statistics-phd/)
and
[here](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/11/09/biostatistics-its-not-what-you-think-it-is/), but
I thought it would be useful to share this short guide I put together based on my recent interactions.

## It's OK to be confused

When I was a college senior I didn't really understand what Applied
Statistics was nor did I understand what one does as a researcher in
academia. Now I love being an academic doing research in applied statistics.
But it is hard to understand what being a researcher is like until you do
it for a while. Things become clearer as you gain more experience. One
important piece of advice is 
to carefully consider advice from those with more
experience than you. It might not make sense at first, but I
can tell today that I knew much less than I thought I did when I was 22. 


## Should I even go to graduate school?

Yes. An undergraduate degree in mathematics, statistics, engineering, or computer science
provides a great background, but some more training greatly increases
your career options. You may be able to learn on the job, but note
that a masters can be as short as a year.

## A masters or a PhD?

If you want a career in academia or as a researcher in industry or
government you need a PhD. In general, a PhD will 
give you more career options. If you want to become a data analyst or
research assistant, a masters may be enough. A masters is also a good way
to test out if this career is a good match for you. Many people do a
masters before applying to PhD Programs. The rest of this guide
focuses on those interested in a PhD.

## What discipline?

There are many disciplines that can lead you to a career in data
science: Statistics, Biostatistics, Astronomy, Economics, Machine Learning, Computational
Biology, and Ecology are examples that come to mind. I did my PhD
in Statistics and got a job in a Department of Biostatistics. So this
guide focuses on Statistics/Biostatistics.

Note that once you finish your PhD you have a chance to become a 
postdoctoral fellow and further focus your training. By then you will have a
much better idea of what you want to do and will have the opportunity
to chose a lab that closely matches your interests.


## What is the difference between Statistics and Biostatistics?

Short answer: very little. I treat them as the same in this guide. Long answer: read
[this](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/11/09/biostatistics-its-not-what-you-think-it-is/).

## How should I prepare during my senior year?

### Math

Good grades in math and statistics classes
are almost a requirement. Good GRE scores help and you need to get a near perfect score in
the Quantitative Reasoning part of the GRE. Get yourself a practice
book and start preparing. Note that to survive the first two years of a statistics PhD program
you need to prove theorems and derive relatively complicated
mathematical results. If you can't easily handle the math part of the GRE, this will be
quite challenging.

When choosing classes note that the area of math most related to your
stat PhD courses is Real
Analysis. The area of math most used in applied work is Linear
Algebra, specifically matrix theory including understanding
eigenvalues and eigenvectors. You might not make the connection between
what you learn in class and what you use in practice until much
later. This is totally normal. 

If you don't feel ready, consider doing a masters first. But also, get
a second opinion. You might be being too hard on yourself.

### Programming

You will be using a computer to analyze data so knowing some
programming is a must these days. At a minimum, take a basic
programming class. Other computer science classes will help especially
if you go into an area dealing with large datasets. In hindsight, I
wish I had taken classes on optimization and algorithm design. 

Know that learning to program and learning a computer language are
different things. You need to learn to program. The choice of language
is up for debate. If you only learn one, learn R. If you learn three,
learn R, Python and C++.

Knowing Linux/Unix is an advantage. If you have a Mac try to use the
terminal as much as possible. On Windows get an emulator.


### Writing and Communicating

My biggest educational regret is that, as a college student, I underestimated the importance
of writing. To this day I am correcting that mistake.

Your success as a researcher greatly depends on how well
you write and communicate. Your thesis, papers, grant
proposals and even emails have to be well written. So practice as much as
possible. Take classes, read works by good writers, and
[practice](http://bulletin.imstat.org/2011/09/terence%E2%80%99s-stuff-speaking-reading-writing/). Consider
starting a blog even if you don't make it public. Also note that in
academia, job interviews will
involve a 50 minute talk as well as several conversations about your
work and future plans. So communication skills are also a big plus. 


## But wait, why so much math?

The PhD curriculum is indeed math heavy. Faculty often debate the
possibility of changing the curriculum. But regardless of 
differing opinions on what is the right amount, math is the
foundation of our discipline. Although it is true that you will not
directly use much of what you learn, I don't regret learning so much abstract
math because I believe it positively shaped the way I think and attack
problems.

Note that after the first two years you are
pretty much done with courses and you start on your research. If you work with an
applied statistician you will learn data analysis via the
apprenticeship model. You will learn the most, by far, during this
stage. So be patient. Watch

for some inspiration.


## What department should I apply to?

The top 20-30 departments are practically interchangeable in my
opinion. If you are interested in applied statistics make sure you
pick a department with faculty doing applied research. Note that some
professors focus their research on the mathematical aspects of
statistics. By reading some of their recent papers you will be able to
tell. An applied paper usually shows data (not simulated) and
motivates a subject area challenge in the abstract or introduction. A
theory paper shows no data at all or uses it only as an example.


## Can I take a year off?

Absolutely. Especially if it's to work in a data related job. In
general, maturity and life experiences are an advantage in grad school.

## What should I expect when I finish?

You will have many many options. The demand of your expertise is
great and growing. As a result there are many high-paying options. If you want to
become an academic I recommend doing a postdoc. [Here](http://simplystatistics.org/2011/12/28/grad-students-in-bio-statistics-do-a-postdoc/) is why.
But there are many other options as we describe [here](http://simplystatistics.org/2015/02/18/navigating-big-data-careers-with-a-statistics-phd/)
 and [here](http://simplystatistics.org/2011/09/12/advice-for-stats-students-on-the-academic-job-market/).
