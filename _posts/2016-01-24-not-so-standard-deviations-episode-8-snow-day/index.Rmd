Hilary and I were snowed in over the weekend, so we recorded Episode 8 of Not So Standard Deviations. In this episode, Hilary and I talk about how to get your foot in the door with data science, the New England Journal's view on data sharing, Google's "Cohort Analysis", and trying to predict a movie's box office returns based on the movie's script.
