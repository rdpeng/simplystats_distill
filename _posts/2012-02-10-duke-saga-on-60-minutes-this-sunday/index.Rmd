This Sunday February 12, the news magazine <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/60minutes/main3415.shtml" target="_blank">60 Minutes</a> will have a feature on the <a href="http://simplystatistics.tumblr.com/post/10068195751/the-duke-saga" target="_blank">Duke Clinical Trials saga</a>. Will Dr. Potti himself make an appearance? This is from the 60 Minutes web site:

> **Deception at Duke -**<span>Â Scott Pelley reports on a Duke University oncologist whose supervisor says he manipulated the data in his study of a breakthrough cancer therapy. Kyra Darnton is the producer.</span>

<span>The word on the street is that the segment will also feature statisticians Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombes of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center.</span>

<span>And that makes two posts this week about people at M.D. Anderson. What&#8217;s going on here?</span>
