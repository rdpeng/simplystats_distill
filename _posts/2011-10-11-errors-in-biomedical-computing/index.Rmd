Biomedical Computation Review has a <a href="http://www.biomedicalcomputationreview.org/7/2/9.pdf" target="_blank">nice summary</a> (in which I am quoted briefly) by Kristin Sainani about the many different types of errors in computational research, including the infamous Duke incident and some other recent examples. The reproducible research policy at _Biostatistics_ is described as an example for how the publication process might need to change to prevent errors from persisting (or occurring).
