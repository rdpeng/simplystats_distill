[This post](https://medium.com/@kristianlum/statistics-we-have-a-problem-304638dc5de5) by Kristian Lum is incredibly brave. It points out some awful behavior by people in our field and should be required reading for everyone. 

It took a lot of courage for Kristian to post this but we believe her, think this is a serious and critical issue for our field, and will not tolerate this kind of behavior among our colleagues. 

Her post has aleady inspired important discussions among the faculty at Johns Hopkins Biostatistics and is an important contribution to making sure our field is welcoming for everyone. 

Like many others we'll be waiting to see the [response of the ISBA](https://twitter.com/KerrieMengersen/status/941413766532493312). The ASA is also [creating a task force](https://twitter.com/AmstatNews/status/941339084093616129) on sexual harrassment. We'll be looking for more details on how to get involved in these efforts as we all think about what we can do about this critical issue.
